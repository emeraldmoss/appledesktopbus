    <h1>Hello from my domain!</h1>
    <p>In 1986 Apple released the IIgs, the last Apple 2 in the line before Macintosh became the official computer of Apple. It featured a wonderfully designed keyboard with key switches that are considered by some to be desirable for their sound and feel. Aside from the switches and design, the AppleIIgs is considered a collectorâ€™s item on its own for the association to vintage computing and Apple.</p>
